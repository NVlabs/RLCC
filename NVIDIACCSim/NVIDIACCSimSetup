echo NVIDIACCSimSetup is ready to use!
echo ------------------------------------
echo To run the simulation get into sim directory and type:
echo "../bin/ccsim_release omnetpp.ini -c <Config> -r <Run number>"
echo Config - determine the algoritm and traffic patterns 
echo Run number - determain the number of Hosts and Qps in the system
echo For more details please check omnetpp.ini file and README file
echo
echo exmple for running RL algorithm simultaneous start many to one traffic type with 2 hosts and one QP per host 
echo " ../bin/ccsim_release omnetpp.ini -c RL_MediumSimult_ManyToOne -r 0"
echo
echo To see detailed list of all the runs of a configuration type:
echo ../bin/ccsim_release omnetpp.ini -x RL_MediumSimult_ManyToOne -g
echo "make sure to comment out: **.PORT_NO_TO_PYTHON = {5555..6666 step 1} before running the above command"
